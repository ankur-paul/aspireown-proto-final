# GOOD LUCK EVERYONE!

### For front end people

For now i have just created the directories for frontend devs...

- You can use assets for static assets
- components for reusable parts like navbars, footer, tables, grids
- pages for different html pages like index.html, about.html, signup page etc

others can create their directories as requied by them...

## Some notes -->

1. when developing some feature do not push directly on the main branch, instead use /feature/feature_name branch.

2. basically we will never push on the main branch, as that is our main development/ stable branch, we will only push on other branches then merge that branch with the main and after that delete the other branch.

3. two people should not work simultaniously in the same file, it will create merge conflicts.
